## Job Search : Online Networking 

With traditional networking you can only be in one place at a time; with online networking you can interact with multiple communities simultaneously. 

**Online Presence**:  

    - Put your name in quotes into a search engine and see what comes back. Do you exist online and is your online presence distinctive? 

    - Add a professional photo to your online profiles. When the photo is missing, people wonder why. 

    - Take the time to create a robust profile on your networking sites; a complete profile is more searchable by recruiters and hiring managers. 

    - Create a public profile with a vanity URL on your networking profiles, with your first and last name, to maximize your exposure 

**Observe**:  

    - Every online community has its own culture. Spend some time observing the culture before you jump in. 

**Avoid** :  

    - Avoid the “I’m looking for work” status updates when chatting in online communities. They make you sound desperate and don’t show your value. 

**Work Daily**:  

    - Online networking does not have a “build it and they will come” mentality; work your online network daily. 

    - Spend about an hour a day working your online network. 

    - Commit to adding at least five new contacts per week and reconnecting with at least five people in your network each week. 

    - Reconnecting with someone you haven’t spoken to in years by calling them is awkward; reconnecting through social media platforms is not.
