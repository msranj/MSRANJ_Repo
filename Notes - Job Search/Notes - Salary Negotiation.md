#### Salary Negotiation 

 
When asked about your current salary, say this- 
 
    1. “I have signed an NDA with my current employer which legally prohibits me from sharing my current salary.” 
    
    2. If they tell you they need the payslips, reply - “I’m happy to share the payslips once you’ve made me an offer and I resign from my current position.” 

 

When asked about salary expectations, use this - 
 
    1. "I am very interested in working with you and very flexible with the salary offered. Can we first discuss the roles and responsibilities?" 
    
    2. If you are forced to answer in numbers, give them a range based on your research. Say “Based on my research, a median salary is between 45-55 LPA. But I'm flexible”
